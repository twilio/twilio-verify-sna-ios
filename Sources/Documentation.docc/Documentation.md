# ``TwilioVerifySNA``

This SDK will help you with process the SNA URL's provided by our `Verify services` to silently validate a phone number.

## Overview

Twilio Silent Network Auth will protect you against account takeovers (ATOs) that target your user's phone number by streamlining your methods for verifying mobile number possession. Instead of sending one-time passcodes (OTPs) that can be stolen or forcing users to implement complicated app-based solutions, Twilio Silent Network Auth will verify mobile number possession directly on the device by using its built-in connectivity to the mobile operatorsâ€™ wireless network.
